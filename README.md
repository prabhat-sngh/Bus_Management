In the Bus.java file, I use encapsulation for data hiding like number, name, model, Seat Capacity, Driver Name, conductor Name, etc. use constructor to assign the values and use getter-setter methods for use data in other files. And lastly, use the toString method for printing the values. Use the ConnectionDetails.java file to set up the driver manager with MySQL. Use the BusService.java file to perform some operations such as adding a new Bus, getting the specific bus by its number, updating the bus information, getting all bus details, delete the bus by its number. use the DBlayer.java file for executing the main method from where I give inputs as constructor parameters or act operation on a particular bus.
